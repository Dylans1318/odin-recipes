            Churros(Mexican Fritters) are very common at fairs. In my boarder hometown, the line at this stand is always overwhelming. People wait hours in line just to get a taste of these churros. I have run across several recipes but this is the best one by far

            <li>1 cup of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 quarts oil for frying</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Steps</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water, 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a small saucepan and place over medium heat. Bring to a boil and remove from the heat. Stir in flour, stirring until mixture forms a ball</li>
            <li>Heat oil for frying in a deep fryer or deep pot to 375 degrees F</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to a sturdy pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip. Carefully pipe a few 5-to-6 inch strips of dough into the hot oil; work in batched so you dont crowd the fryer.Cook until golden; use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer churros to paper towel to drain</li>
