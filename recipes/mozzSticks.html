        <h4>Mozzarella Cheese Sticks</h4>
        <p>
            Mozzarella sticks are very easy to make at home. They're deep-fried untill golden and crispy on the outside, with melty gooey cheese on the inside.
            They're so good and take just minutes to fry! Try dipping them in marinara sauce!
